    - Variables and data structurees
        - Variable
            - integer
            - real number
            - booleann
            - strings
            - complex types
                - lists
                    - holds an array of values list = []
                - dictionaries
                    - similar to list but uses hash maps store key and value pairs
                    - ex. dict = {'test': 21, 'ssh': 35}
    - Input Output
        - input(): gets a string froom user and puts in a variabe
    - Selection
        - allows program to make choices one of three programming concepts
    - Functions
    - Iteration
    - File I/O
    - Exception handling
        - catches errors
        - avoid hard crashes
        - good for user experience
    - Modules
        - collections of codes written by other people
        - http://docs.python.org/3/library/
- <Intermediate>
    - Classes
        - data structure or type 
        - holds data behaviour called as attributes and methods
        - pattern to create object
            - object is like variable hold whole class info inside
        - Methods
            - basic method (can do almost anything)
            - special methods
                - basic(initiation, new and delete)
                - descriptors(get, set)
                - container(for emulating list like classses)
                - numeric(overriding operators of +-%)
                - all methods in python requires self param
        - Initialization
            - important feature in oop
            - allows for creation of attributes or settings of values
            - allows all obj creation to be done in one line
        - Method Objects
            - the ability to store a function in variable
    - Inheritence
    - Iterators and generators
    - Modulating code
