- <Beginner>
    - Variables and data structurees
        - Variable
            - integer
            - real number
            - booleann
            - strings
            - complex types
                - lists
                    - holds an array of values list = []
                - dictionaries
                    - similar to list but uses hash maps store key and value pairs
                    - ex. dict = {'test': 21, 'ssh': 35}
    - Input Output
        - input(): gets a string froom user and puts in a variabe
    - Selection
        - allows program to make choices one of three programming concepts
    - Functions
    - Iteration
    - File I/O
    - Exception handling
        - catches errors
        - avoid hard crashes
        - good for user experience
    - Modules
        - collections of codes written by other people
        - http://docs.python.org/3/library/

- <Intermediate>
    - Classes
        - data structure or type 
        - holds data behaviour called as attributes and methods
        - pattern to create object
            - object is like variable hold whole class info inside
        - Methods
            - basic method (can do almost anything)
            - special methods
                - basic(initiation, new and delete)
                - descriptors(get, set)
                - container(for emulating list like classses)
                - numeric(overriding operators of +-%)
                - all methods in python requires self param
        - Initialization
            - important feature in oop
            - allows for creation of attributes or settings of values
            - allows all obj creation to be done in one line
        - Method Objects
            - the ability to store a function in variable
                - base / super class | sub-class
        - Inheritence
            - concept of class inheriting features from another class
        - Polymorphism
            - concept of dynamic methods chosen runtime
            - subclasses must override the base class method
        - Multiple Inheritence
            - inherit from more than one base separating them with comma
    - Iterators and generators
        - iterators
            - Python uses __iter__() method to return an iterator object of the class
            - then uses __next__() method to get next item
        - generators
            - another way to create iterators
            - uses function rather than separate class
            - uses called yield which saves the state of the generator
            - allows iteration to be handled by single line exp.
    - Modulating code
        - Process of splitting up our program into multiple files
        - Allows complex packages to be made
        - Great for writing tool packs for other developers
        - Packages
            - hierarchical structure to large compilations of modules
            - ex. physic engines, networking tools, gui

- <Advanced>
    - Templates
        - part of string module
        - allows data to change without having to edit the app
        - can be modified with subclass
        - errors
            - key error: no key in template
            - bad placeholder: value error
        - ^ handled by safe_substitute()
        - custom delimeter could be overrided
